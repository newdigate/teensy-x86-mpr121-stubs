 *
 *  This is a library for the MPR121 I2C 12-chan Capacitive Sensor
 *
 *  Designed specifically to work with the MPR121 sensor from Adafruit
 *  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/1982
 *
 *  These sensors use I2C to communicate, 2+ pins are required to
 *  interface
 *
 *  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
 *  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
 *  products from Adafruit!

 * even baseline value changes. Typically the touch threshold is a little bigger
 * than the release threshold to touch debounce and hysteresis. For typical
 * touch application, the value can be in range 0x05~0x30 for example. The
 * setting of the threshold is depended on the actual application. For the
 * operation details and how to set the threshold refer to application note
 * AN3892 and MPR121 design guidelines.
